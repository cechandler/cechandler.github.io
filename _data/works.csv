,Recast Fragments,chamber electroacoustic,2015,"clarinet, violin, cello, piano, and electroacoustic music",9,Ensemble U:,Third Practice Electroacoustic Music Festival,recast-fragments,,,"Recasting is the process of giving new form to an object by melting it down and reshaping it. This metaphor captures the way in which I approached composing the four movements of <em>Recast Fragments</em>. In the first and third movements, the musical material has been rearranged and reworked with respect to instrumental register, orchestration, timbre, and the electronics. The second and fourth movements share the same harmonic framework and sense of atmosphere but the details of the musical surface have been significantly transformed.

Each domain engages in a sort of cross-pollination with the other, where ideas from the acoustic world appear in the electronics and vice versa, resulting in an overall integrated gestalt. In Smoke and Mirrors, I took this approach again with the guiding concept of considering the ensemble and electronics as two components of an object or image capable of gradually coming into and out of focus. Smoke and Mirrors was commissioned as part of the 2012 ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commissioning Program and has been released on CD the Music from SEAMUS Volume 23."

,"in shadow, in shade",electroacoustic solo,2012,piano and electroacoustic music,9,Keith Kirchoff,,In-shadow-in-shade,,,"I spent several weeks of the summer of 2012 in France attending a music festival, sightseeing, and trying to absorb as much of the language, culture, and scenery as possible. To complete my immersion experience, I read some French poetry and found the title of this piece in the Victor Hugo poem “La Tombe Dit À La Rose.” The work captures the atmosphere of the poem and also refers to the way in which the electronics relate to the pianist- often shadowing or following the performer but occasionally asserting itself with quick dynamic interjections."

My intention was not to set this poem in a programmatic sense, but rather I sought to explore and respond to its rich atmosphere and vivid imagery. "

,Doppelgänger,electroacoustic,2010,"percussion, live electronics, and electroacoustic music",8,,,doppelgänger,,,"A doppelgänger is a ghostly, sinister double of a living person that haunts its counterpart. In <em>Doppelgänger</em>, for percussion and live electronics, this idea of doubling is explored in the electroacoustic component, which shadows the percussionist by reinterpreting and recontextualizing the acoustic material. The percussionist alternates between structured and improvisatory sections creating a flexible environment that allows a dialogue between acoustic and electroacoustic worlds."

,The Spark of Opposites,electroacoustic solo,2009,cello and electroacoustic music,10,Heather Stebbins,,the-spark-of-opposites,the-spark-of-opposites,,"“Life is born only of the spark of opposites.” <br>
-Carl Jung<br>
<br>
Psychologist Carl Jung believed individuals to be a living system of opposites. Conscious and unconscious, good and evil, rational and irrational. The tension created by the presence of opposites and the process of acknowledging both, he argued, was necessary to create any sort of forward momentum and resolution that would ultimately lead to personal growth and individuation. <em>The Spark of Opposites</em> is an exploration and embodiment of this process. It was commissioned by and is dedicated to my great friend and very talented composer/performer Heather Stebbins."

The piece exploits the resonance that is left after a sharp attack. The gradual harmonic and timbral unfolding of this resonance heard in the opening creates a slowly evolving and quiet musical landscape that encourages introspection.

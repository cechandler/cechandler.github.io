I"»<p>This summer I will be attending a new music workshop and festival in Qu√©bec called <a href="http://www.domaineforget.com"><em>Domaine Forget</em></a>. Soon I will be getting started on a new work for large ensemble which will be workshopped and premiered at the festival by <a href="http://www.lenem.ca">Le Nouvel Ensemble Moderne</a>. I am really looking forward to having the opportunity to working with them and conductor Lorraine Vaillancourt.</p>

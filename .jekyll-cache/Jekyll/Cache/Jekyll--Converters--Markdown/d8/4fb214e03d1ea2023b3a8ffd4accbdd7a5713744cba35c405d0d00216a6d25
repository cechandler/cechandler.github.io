<p>Below you can find a selection of recent tools that I have developed for compositional and analytical projects. Some of these are still in active development, so be aware there may be bugs or idiosyncrasies in functionality. There are links to download some of the tools, and all that I ask is that you let me know if you find them useful and please give attribution if you repurpose some of my work in your own.

<h2 class="my-3">Generative Sound File Player</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/gsfp1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of GSFP" /></p>

<p>The Generative Sound File Player is my most recent tool that allows for the algorithmic sound file playback with controls for real-time manipulation. One can load up and sequence any number of sound files using a variety of parameters, which you can see on the interface screenshot above. In this screenshot and the video demo below, there are two independent voices that can be triggered. But an arbitrary number of separate voices is possible, constrained only by the processing power of the computer it is running on. The controls to interact with the GSFP are currently only text-based but the organization of the software allows for easy implementation of graphic control (through user interface objects or touch-based controllers) in the near future.</p>

<p>The functionality of the parameters in the image above are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wait time:</code> the duration of time (in milliseconds) between the onsets of the GSFP being triggered</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">density:</code> the number of ‚Äúnotes‚Äù or sound files to be triggered at the moment of an onset</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset:</code> the time variation (in milliseconds) between note onsets (ie., the onset of the GFSP triggers 5 sounds, they can all happen at once with a delta of 0 or be displaced in time from one another)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">buffers:</code> the buffer names of sounds to use (folders of sounds can also be loaded with the keyword <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sset</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">amp:</code> amplitude levels of sound file playback</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attack time:</code> the duration of the envelope‚Äôs attack (in milliseconds)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attack curve:</code> the slope or curve of the envelope‚Äôs attack (in milliseconds (positive values give a logarithmic curve, negative values give an exponential curve, and zero gives a linear ramp)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">release time:</code> the duration of the envelope‚Äôs release (in milliseconds)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">release curve:</code> same as attack curve but for the release of the sound</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rate:</code> playback rate, where 1.0 is normal speed (0.5 is half speed, 2.0 is twice speed); specific keywords allow one to transpose in intervals (ie., 1 for minor 2nd higher, -12 for octave lower) or midicents (ie., 100 for minor second higher, -50 for quarter step lower, 1200 for octave higher)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">start position:</code> the location within a given buffer from which to begin playback, where 0.0 is the beginning of the file and 1.0 is the end</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pan:</code> the stereo location of the sound on a range from -1.0 to 1.0 (left to right)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">out:</code> output channels that the given voice will be sent
    <ul>
      <li>for the moment, everything is reduced to a stereo image</li>
      <li>however, the different output channels allows each voice to be separated into a stereo stem when a recording is made</li>
      <li>using the recording controls in the upper right corner of the top row, set the number of channels you need in the number box (e.g., 16), press the toggle, and make sound</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Inside the software there is a flexible and powerful custom abstraction called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">the_patterner</code> that allows one to control each of these parameters through the use of special keywords. Keywords are followed by arguments (integers, floating point numbers, and symbols) that allow for variation and randomization of a given parameter. At the current moment there are several functioning keywords, below is a list of them and the way in which they can be implemented (optional arguments are given in &lt;these braces&gt;):</p>

          <li>exp <slope> (exponential probability weighted towards upper values)</slope></li>
          <li>rexp <slope> (reverse exponential probability weighted towards lower values)
</slope>            <ul>
              <li>slope: greater than 1.0 = steeper slope</li>
              <li>default slope = 2.0</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

<h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Granular Synthesis</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/img/granular-synthesis.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Screenshot of Granular Synth" /></p>

<p>Granular synthesis is a powerful tool for sound design that I frequently use in my compositional work. This custom patch in Max/MSP is a creative tool for sound generation and also a pedagogical tool that I have given to students, allowing them to explore granular synthesis and all of its essential parameters through this interface.</p>

<p>The software:</p>

<ul>
  <li>uses both synchronous and asynchronous granular synthesis</li>
  <li>can load 3 sound files (but it‚Äôs arbitrary to increase that number)</li>
  <li>can randomly select from those files or use only one</li>
  <li>allows a wide range of grain rate and grain size (controlled via the XY slider in the center)</li>
  <li>allows for a variety of window shapes to be applied to grains</li>
  <li>gives controls for traversal rate through the sound file and transposition of it</li>
  <li>allows for recording the output in separate module (not pictured)</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Composition Tools</h2>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/comp-tools-sets.png" alt="Screenshot of Comp Tools" /></p>

<p><img class="img-fluid" src="/assets/img/comp-tools-interval-cycles.png" alt="Screenshot of Interval Cycles" /></p>

<p>I have built a number of set theory tools for composition and analysis, two of which are shown above. Most of the tools make extensive use of the <a href="http://http://www.bachproject.net/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bach</code></a> externals for calculations and notation display.</p>

<p>In the first picture shown above, the interface takes a list of pitch-classes from which a number of useful characteristics are displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prime form, normal form, interval vector, and complement</li>
  <li>all transpositions, inversions, M, and MI operations</li>
  <li>common tones between these operations</li>
  <li>Robert Morris‚Äô set class inclusion table and all members included with a given set class</li>
</ul>

<p>The second screenshot displays a tool for generating a sequence of interval cycle chords. The tool allows for up to four voices with independent interval cycle collections. The contour, starting pitch, octave location, and rotation of each voice can all be controlled. The sequence of chords can be auditioned, and further manipulated using any of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bach.roll</code> notation display functions (including expanding/compressing duration and transposition).</p>

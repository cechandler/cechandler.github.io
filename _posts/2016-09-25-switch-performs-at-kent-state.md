The Switch~ Ensemble performed on the Vanguard New Music Guest Artist Series at Kent State University on September 25th. The group included myself, Matt Evans (saxophone), and Wei-Han Wu (piano). In addition to the concert, we talked about our ensemble's history and gave a workshop on our use of technology, and Matt gave a masterclass to saxophone students. Our program included works by:

Alex Mincek - *Pendulum III* for saxophone and piano  
Jonathan Harvey - *Tombeau de Messiaen* for piano & electronics  
Jason Thorpe Buchanan - *Second Study for Alto Saxophone, Electronics, and Video: pulp*  
Eric Wubbels - *this is this is this is* for saxophone and piano

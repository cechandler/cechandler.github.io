I had a great week at Lawrence University for SEAMUS! I was able to hear some new music, catch up with old friends, and make some new ones. The trip was especially exciting as I was awarded Second Prize in the 2012 ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Commission Competition! Congratulations to the First Prize recipient, <a href="http://www.elifieldsteel.com/">Eli Fieldsteel</a>, and the other finalists <a href="http://erikdeluca.com/">Erik DeLuca</a> and <a href="http://www.laniersammons.com/Main/">Lanier Sammons</a>. As part of the award, SEAMUS has commissioned me to write a new work of my own choosing for the 2013 conference at McNally Smith College of Music in St. Paul, Minnesota.

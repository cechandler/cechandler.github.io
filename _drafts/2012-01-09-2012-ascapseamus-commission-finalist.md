I am thrilled that *the resonance after...* has been nominated as one of four finalists for the 2012 ASCAP/SEAMUS Student Composer Commission Competition! The piece will be performed at the upcoming 2012 SEAMUS Conference and Festival at Lawrence University, where the first and second prize winners will be announced.
